JVP School is an international school that strives to educate children for life and change. Our learning philosophy infuses traditional values into a progressive approach, equipping students to become independent, have their feet firmly on the ground, yet adapt and excel in their chosen fields anywhere in the world. We nurture inventive thinking and believe our children must develop multiple faculties in order to engage effectively in global and connected ways. Through a balance of intellectual vigor, sports and arts, we instill a lifelong passion to think, grow and learn.
